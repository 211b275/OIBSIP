In this code:

I declared the Choice variable and initialized it appropriately.
I declared the seat array with a size of 10, which represents the availability of seats.
I defined a Cut_Reservation method (you can implement it as needed).
In the main method, I provided comments to help you understand the flow of the code.
Please note that this is a simplified example, and you should adapt it to your specific requirements. Make sure to implement the Cut_Reservation method and handle the choice cases according to your application's logic. Additionally, you might need to add error handling and input validation as necessary.
